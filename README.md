Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the writing of instructions, (code) that a computer uses/reads and interprets using
compilers into commands that it can understand then gives out the desired output. so basically, it is giving 
computers commands through code to get a disered out put. 

For industires, software engineering is like a root, it is used for companies websites, servers, and management systems. In most companies they use this technology to enhance security and and data protection.
Web pages are built by software engineers, these web pages increase end user interaction with industries  which in turn boosts bussiness growth.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

 1: The birth (The NATO coonfrence) > Everything starts somewhere, as for software engineeering, it was first intorduced at the NATO Softaware Engineering Confrence in the year 1968. It was introduced so as to help address software crisis where costly software projects were delivered late and at times the could even fail totally.

 2: Introduction of Structured programming > before its time, code wasn't structured which made thing hard when trying to debug and maintain it. the introduction of structured aimed to solve this problem where by structured code looked alot cleaner, this was archived by introducing functions, top-down design and loop construction.

 3: Rise of Agile Methodologies > Adaptability was so complex on early code, this led to the introduction of Agile Manifesto which priotized flexibility, customer collaboration and iteractive developmant.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning: On this phace, the estimation if time, budget and risks to be encoutered is discussed, Its also the phace whereby the best programming languages for a various are choosen.
2. Requirement analysis: All stake holder's needs are understood and documents, both funtional and non-functional are gathered.
3. Design: The system architecture, database design and UI/UX mockups are held on this phase, it's where technical specification and software components are defined.
4. Coding/Imlementation: The actual code is wrote based om the provided design, programming languages, frame-works and tools
5. Testing: The code is tested to check ; 1. if it meets the requirements, 2. for bugs, 3. system settings, security, perfomance and reliability.
6. Deployment: The code is released to the end-user or production environment
7. Maintenance/support: Includes updates, bug fixes and enhancements to ensure long-term software stability and perfomance. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

ASPECT	                WATERFALL                           AGILE
Approach	              Sequential and linear	              Iterative and incremental
Flexibility	            Rigid, inadaptable to changes	      Highly flexible, allows continuous adjustments
Phases	                Follows a strict sequence 	        Works in iterative cycles (sprints)
Documentation	          Extensive documentation 	          Minimal documentation
Customer Involvement	  Limited involvement 	              Continuous collaboration with stakeholders
Delivery Time	          Delivered at the end of the project	Software is delivered in small, working increments
Risk Management	        Higher risk 	                      Lower risk 
Best for	              Projects with well-defined, stable  Projects with evolving requirements and rapid                            requirements                        changes  




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software developer: He/She is resposible for designing, coding, an implementing software solutions
2. Quality assuarance Engineer: They ensure the software meets the pre-defined requirements and quality standards before deployment
3. Project manager: They are the project overseers, they ensure the software development goes well within the provided time and budget. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

And 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
